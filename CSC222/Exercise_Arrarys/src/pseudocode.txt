* Establish a connection to stdin with a Scanner instance
* Create an integer array with a length of 5
* Loop the integer array and track the current index
    * Print prompt line
    * Wait for an integer input
    * Store the integer input in the corresponding array index
* Begin a while loop that will not end until a break condition is given
    * Display the menu of functional options the user can choose from
    * Display menu prompt
    * Wait for an integer input
    * If menu prompt is 4
        * Break out of the function loop
    * If menu prompt is 1
        * Display all 5 numbers in a single line using a for loop over the integer array
        * Continue to the next iteration
    * If menu prompt is 2
        * Create and initialize an accumulator with a value of java.lang.Integer.MIN_VALUE
        * Loop over each element of the integer array
            * If the current array value is greater than the accumulator
                * Set the accumulator to the current array value
        * Display the accumulator as the max value of the integer array
    * If menu prompt is 3
        * Create and initialize an accumulator with a value of 0
        * Loop over each element of the integer array
            * Add the current integer value to the accumulator
        * Calculate the average by dividing the accumulator by length of the integer array
        * Display that average result as a float to the tenth precision
* Stop the program
